# TW5-editions
A (still growing) collection of different editions of the [Tiddlywiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com/)(TW5) single page application

Currently contains the following editions, all built on TW5 v5.1.14:

1. Empty edition: The "empty" edition of TiddlyWiki is a vanilla distribution, with only maarfapad plugin, and no configuration beyond the core code.
2. The "full" (tiddlywiki.html) edition of TiddlyWiki consists of all the available languages, themes and plugins for TiddlyWiki. It is intended for use in testing TiddlyWiki - in particular, for switching between all the available language plugins.
