# TW5-editions
A (still growing) collection of useful editions of [Tiddlywiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com/)(TW5) that I use.

Currently contains the following editions, all built on TW5 v5.1.18:

1. Empty edition: The "empty" edition of TiddlyWiki is a vanilla distribution, with only maarfapad plugin and core code.
2. JD Whitespace: a beautiful edition with a sidebar that has extended functionality with a UI that focused on whitespace
3. Streambook: a RoamResearch-esque edition with a 2 panel story view and outline system
